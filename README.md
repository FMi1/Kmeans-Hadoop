# K-means Hadoop

Cloud Computing Project regarding Big Data Processing module.

This project and the [ "Kmeans-Spark"](https://github.com/lossi771/Kmeans-Spark/) are part of the same Cloud Computing Project for Big Data Processing whose specification can be found in the PDF file [ "Kmeans Specs"](https://github.com/lossi771/Kmeans-Spark/blob/master/Kmeans%20Specs.pdf)

The classes that implement the required specification can be found inside the direcoty
["Kmeans/src/main/java/it/unipi/hadoop/Kmeans/"](https://github.com/lossi771/K-means-Hadoop/tree/master/Kmeans/src/main/java/it/unipi/hadoop/Kmeans).

 
The ["generate_points.py"](https://github.com/lossi771/Kmeans-Spark/blob/master/generate_points.py) is the script related to the dataset generation according to Section 1.1. inside the [ "report"](https://github.com/lossi771/Kmeans-Spark/blob/master/report.pdf). The latter contains other useful information and a short description of the most relevant feature of this project.
